# Integrating Explainable AI into Surfline's Surf Forecasting Models For More Interpretable Surf Forecasting



## Project Description

### Section 1: Introduction

The current surf forecasting system provided by Surfline only offers limited information on swell height, tide, wind, and a simple rating of poor, fair, good, or something in between. This doesn't accurately reflect the complexities of conditions that impact a surfer's experience at a specific spot. The proposed project aims to revolutionize the way surfers approach their sessions by providing them with personalized surf forecasting tools that incorporate advanced Explainable AI techniques and real surf forecaster's reports.

### Section 2: The Need for Personalized Surf Forecasting

Everyone's ideal surf conditions are different and vary depending on skill level, board choice, and personal preferences. While some may find perfect conditions in large waves and strong winds, others may prefer smaller, cleaner waves. Understanding what the waves will be like, and who they are for, past just wave heights and a simple rating, as well as what is causing them to be the way they are, are the core concepts of this project. This is why the proposed project aims to deliver a more comprehensive understanding of surf conditions that is tailored to each surfer's unique preferences and needs.

### Section 3: Our Proposed Solution

The proposed solution incorporates additional factors, such as sandbar changes, skill level of the surfer, and specific wave characteristics, into the surf forecasting system. The interactive web-based tool, which will be developed using Explainable AI, will provide surfers with a visual and easy to use interface for exploring and understanding the conditions and reasons behind them. The tool will also incorporate real surf forecasters' reports to determine the wave specifics not reflected in Surfline's reports, providing a more in-depth understanding of the conditions.

### Section 4: Benefits to Surfers

The personalized surf forecasting tools will provide surfers of all skill levels with a more informed understanding of surf conditions. This will allow them to make better decisions about their surfing sessions, resulting in a more enjoyable and successful experience in the water. The proposed solution will also bring new insights and understanding to the sport, allowing surfers to better plan and prepare for their sessions.

### Section 5: Methodology

The development process of the interactive web-based tool will involve integrating Explainable AI techniques to provide surfers with a personalized and interpretable experience. Data sources used in the project will be processed and incorporated to provide an accurate and comprehensive understanding of surf conditions.

### Section 6: Conclusion

The proposed project offers a solution to the limitations of Surfline's current surf forecasting system by providing surfers with a personalized and comprehensive understanding of surf conditions. The advanced surf forecasting tools will enhance the surfing experience for surfers of all skill levels, bringing new insights and understanding to the sport. We invite surfers to try out the new system and experience the difference for themselves.

## Goals
1. Incorporate real surf forecaster's reports and other readily available data to provide more specific insight into surf conditions and cater them to the right audience.
2. Implement Explainable AI to provide explanations for the specific conditions and catering.
3. Develop an interactive web-based tool for surfers to access personalized surf forecasts.
4. Design and implement a user-friendly interface for surfers to explore and understand surf conditions.
